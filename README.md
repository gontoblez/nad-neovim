## Introduction
This is a neovim `config` that was created by combining some of my neovim `config`
in addition to other people's configs who will be mentioned in the
[Special Thanks](#special-thanks) section. Feel free to copy this configuration
and use it, fork it, etc. If you would like something implemented in this main
`config` open a PR.

## Features
### LSP
This neovim `config` has [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)
installed. There's autocompletion support for various languages including:
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Script
* Latex
* Bash
* Markdown

If you'd like support for more languages you can install their servers using
the `:Mason` command after setting up this `config`

### Git Integration
This neovim `config` has [fugitive] and [gitsigns] plugins installed to provide
aesthetics to the buffer window in addition to git functionality. You can use
[fugitive] by using the binding `<leader>gs` which will let you stage your changes
and commit them.
